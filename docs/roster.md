# Fab Roster

The roster is 83 specialists organized around factory phases. Workflow code in `src/workflows.ts` fans out across phase-scoped multiagent sessions; there is no top-level coordinator agent. Anthropic's Managed Agents caps a multiagent roster at 20 unique agents and does not nest coordinators, so each phase runs as its own session and workflow code orchestrates across them.

## Naming convention

- **`-curator`** — stewards knowledge of a system, service, or platform. Curators know about something deeply; they consult, review, advise. Examples: `aws-curator`, `landing-zone-curator`, `claude-curator`, `notion-curator`.
- **`-engineer`** — produces code or configuration with a tool, framework, or language. Engineers build with something. Examples: `react-engineer`, `opentofu-engineer`, `helm-engineer`, `kyverno-engineer`.
- **process names** — no suffix. Gate / checkpoint roles owned by the merge gate. Examples: `pr-reviewer`, `build-verifier`, `artifact-auditor`, `release-manager`, `external-reviewer`.

The split exists so we can compose a knowledge expert with a production engineer on the same task. An `aws-curator` advises on Well-Architected pillars and service selection; an `opentofu-engineer` writes the HCL that implements the recommendation.

Group assignment (`group` field on each `TeamMember`):

- **factory** — Discovery, Design, Build, Verify, Ship. Output is shippable artifacts. Gets `FACTORY_PREAMBLE` injected by `buildSystemPrompt`.
- **firm** — Operate, Customer, Business, System Curators, Staff. Runs the business.
- **lab** — Lab. Meta-work: calibration, prompt analysis, pattern extraction.

## File layout

`src/team.ts` is a barrel that re-exports from per-phase files. Each file declares ≤ 8 specialists so it stays readable.

## Gate roles

The merge gate uses four specialist roles plus an out-of-band calibration:

- `pr-reviewer` — architecture, patterns, frontend craft, code quality dimensions of the quality rubric.
- `qa-security` — security + systems dimensions.
- `build-verifier` — testing + devops + version_currency dimensions; runs the four-phase contract.
- `artifact-auditor` — documentation + consistency dimensions; verifies scope-ledger + link integrity.
- `external-reviewer` — cold-context calibration. Grades all 9 dimensions without seeing internal verdicts. Drift > 1 letter blocks the merge.

`compliance-curator` joins the Verify phase for regulated workloads; its findings are advisory unless the brief explicitly gates on compliance.

## Skill overlay

Every role's skill resolves through the overlay chain documented in `skills/README.md`:

```
$FAB_SKILLS_DIR → ~/.fab/skills/ → <cwd>/.fab/skills/ → bundled fab/skills/
```

Curators and engineers have bundled baselines at `fab/skills/<def.name>.md`. Override any of them via `~/.fab/skills/<def.name>.md` (replace) or `<def.name>.append.md` (append). The brief-typed roles (`product`, `design-lead`, `sales-lead`, `marketing-lead`) resolve to nanohype brief templates by default.
